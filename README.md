# Installation Instructions
This has been tested only on Ubuntu 20.04 (LTS at the time of writing) but it should work on pretty much any operating system. If you have trouble, feel free to open an issue. Important note: this forum software is in development still. It may not be secure and isn't ready for production.

1. Install the latest versions of the following software: Apache 2, MySQL, PHP. You will also need the PHP-MySQL plugin.
2. Setup the software. You will want to create a MySQL user and a MySQL database for the forum to use. The config should be filled out by you with this user's details.
3. Navigate to your forum's install script. E.g. if it's hosted at example.com go to example.com/installer.
4. You will want to create an account and set it as an administrator through the database. You will also want to create some categories and perhaps a thread or two.
5. Enjoy! It should be smooth sailing from here.
